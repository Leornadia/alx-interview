# N Queens Problem

## Introduction

The N Queens problem is a classic puzzle in computer science and mathematics. The challenge is to place `N` non-attacking queens on an `NÃ—N` chessboard. A solution must ensure that no two queens threaten each other, meaning no two queens can share the same row, column, or diagonal.

## Requirements

- The program is implemented in Python and adheres to the PEP 8 style guide.
- The script is designed to be run in a command-line environment on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.
- The program accepts a single command-line argument, `N`, which represents the size of the chessboard and the number of queens.

## Usage

```bash
./0-nqueens.py N
