# 0x04. UTF-8 Validation

## Description
This project involves implementing a Python function `validUTF8(data)` that determines whether a given data set represents a valid UTF-8 encoding. 

## Background
UTF-8 is a variable-width character encoding capable of encoding all 1,112,064 valid code points in Unicode using one to four 8-bit bytes. The encoding is defined by the Unicode standard, and its name is derived from Unicode (or Universal Coded Character Set) Transformation Format â€“ 8-bit.

## Function Prototype
```python
def validUTF8(data):
    """
    Determines if a given data set represents a valid UTF-8 encoding.

    Args:
        data (list): A list of integers representing the data to be validated.

    Returns:
        bool: True if data is a valid UTF-8 encoding, False otherwise.
    """
    # Implementation goes here
    pass
