# 0x02. Minimum Operations

This project explores the minimum number of operations required to achieve a specific number of characters in a file using only "Copy All" and "Paste" operations. The project involves applying dynamic programming principles and understanding the characteristics of prime factorization.

## Requirements

* Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
* Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `python3` (version 3.4.3)
* All your files should end with a new line
* The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
* A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
* Your code should be documented
* Your code should use the PEP 8 style (version 1.7.x)
* All your files must be executable

## Concepts

* **Dynamic Programming:** A technique for solving problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems and storing their results to avoid redundant calculations.
* **Prime Factorization:** Expressing an integer as a product of its prime factors.
* **Code Optimization:** Techniques for improving the efficiency and performance of code.
* **Greedy Algorithms:** Algorithms that make locally optimal choices at each step, hoping to reach a globally optimal solution.
* **Basic Python Programming:** Proficiency in Python, including loops, conditionals, and functions.

## Usage

The main file `0-main.py` provides examples for testing the solution. To run the tests, navigate to the project directory in your terminal and execute:

```bash
./0-main.py
