# 0x09. Island Perimeter

## Project Overview

This project aims to calculate the perimeter of a single island in a grid represented by a 2D array of integers. The task involves applying knowledge of algorithms, data structures (specifically matrices or 2D lists), and iterative or conditional logic to solve a geometric problem within a grid context.

## Concepts Needed

### 2D Arrays (Matrices)
- Accessing and iterating over elements in a 2D array.
- Understanding how to navigate through adjacent cells (horizontally and vertically).

### Conditional Logic
- Applying conditions to determine whether a cell contributes to the perimeter of the island.

### Counting Techniques
- Developing a method to count the edges that contribute to the islandâ€™s perimeter.

### Problem-Solving Strategies
- Breaking down the problem into smaller tasks, such as identifying land cells and calculating their contribution to the perimeter.

### Python Programming
- Nested loops for iterating over grid cells.
- Conditional statements to check the status of adjacent cells.
